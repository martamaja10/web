On behalf of the developers, contributors and user community: **welcome to ROOT!**

If you have never used ROOT before and don't know where to start, we recommend that you first explore: https://github.com/root-project/student-course

For that purpose you don't need to install ROOT on your machine, you can directly run all the examples and exercises 
on [SWAN](https://swan.cern.ch){:target="_blank"} (if you have a CERN computing account), otherwise either using github codespaces or binder. 

The course is written in python. We use jupyter notebooks as the basis to both explain the fundamental concepts and show the code examples. 
We also provide a few exercises that you can attempt on your own. If you want to know a bit more and complete a few more exercises, 
we added some extra material that can be found in the above repository as well. 

Once you are a bit more familiar with what ROOT offers and how to use it online, you can take a look at how to install it on your machine 
[install]({{ '/install' | relative_url }}). 

Finally, if you wish to delve a bit further into ROOT functionalities, check the following: 
* The [ROOT beginners' guide (aka "Primer")]({{ '/primer' | relative_url }})
* The [Manual]({{ '/manual' | relative_url }}) where more in depth information can be found
* The full [API Documentation](https://root.cern/doc/master/){:target="_blank"}
* The [tutorials]({{ '/tutorials' | relative_url }})

Lastly, in case you have a problem or a question, don't hesitate to use the [ROOT Forum](https://root-forum.cern.ch){:target="_blank"}
